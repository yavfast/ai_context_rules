# Active Context (MUST)

- On every new chat start, ALWAYS load and follow `ai_memory/active_context.md`.
- Keep `ai_memory/active_context.md` continuously synchronized with the current chat/task state.
- The rules and required template for updating/syncing the active context are defined in `docs/context_rules/context_rules.md` and MUST be followed.
